## Introduction

The application takes input using prompts to create a list of employees along with their respective payroll information. The data is dynamically updated, allowing payroll managers to see the latest payroll details without needing to refresh the page. The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on devices of all sizes. CSS media queries and flexible layouts are used to adapt the design to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
